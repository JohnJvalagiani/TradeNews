# Approach 1: Cron Job-Based Subscription
# ---------------------------------------

# Cron Job Configuration (Scheduled to run periodically)
using static System.Runtime.InteropServices.JavaScript.JSType;

CRON_SCHEDULE = "*/30 * * * *"  # Every 30 minutes

# On Cron Job Execution
function CronJobCheckNewsAndSendNotification():
    # Check for new news updates
    newNews = CheckForNewNews()

    # Iterate through subscribed users
    for user in GetAllSubscribedUsers():
        # Check if any of the new news matches the user's subscriptions
        matchingNews = FilterMatchingNews(user.subscriptions, newNews)


        if matchingNews:
            # Send notifications to the user for matching news
            SendNotifications(user, matchingNews)

# Advantages of Cron Job:
# - Simplicity: Easy to schedule and implement.
# - Predictability: Runs at specified intervals.
# - Resource Efficiency: Suitable for periodic tasks.

# Disadvantages of Cron Job:
# - Delayed Notifications: Users may not receive immediate updates.
# - Scalability: May become resource-intensive with many users.
# - Complexity: Handling different schedules and retries can be complex.

# Approach 2: Event-Based Subscription
# -------------------------------------

# User Subscriptions Database Structure
# {
#   "user_id": "123",
#   "subscriptions": ["Tech News", "Financial Updates"]
# }

# Event Listener (Listens for news events)
function NewsEventListener(event):
    # Get the user subscriptions for the news event
    subscribedUsers = GetSubscribedUsersForNews(event.news)

    if subscribedUsers:
        # Send notifications to the subscribed users
        SendNotifications(subscribedUsers, event.news)

# Advantages of Event-Based Approach:
# - Real-Time Notifications: Users receive notifications as soon as matching news is available.
# - Scalability: Scales easily with a large number of users.
# - Simplicity: Decouples notification logic from news checking.
# - Flexibility: Supports various event-driven architectures.

# Disadvantages of Event-Based Approach:
# - Event Handling Complexity: Implementing event listeners can be more complex.
# - Infrastructure: Requires a messaging system or event bus.

# Comparing Approaches:
# - Events provide real-time notifications, while cron jobs have delays.
# - Events scale better for a large number of users.
# - Cron jobs are simpler to set up but may lead to delayed notifications.
# - Events provide more flexibility for event-driven architectures.

# Conclusion:
# For real-time user notifications and scalability, the event-based approach is preferred over cron jobs.


## Estimated Time Breakdown


## Cron Job-Based Subscription

- Setting up a basic cron job for periodic news checking and notification: 1-2 hours.
- Implementing news checking logic, user subscription management, and notification sending: 15-30 hours.
- Testing and debugging: 10 hours.
- **Total estimated time: 25-45 hours.**

## Event-Based Subscription

- Setting up an event-driven architecture with a messaging system or event bus: 10-15 hours.
- Implementing event listeners, news checking logic, user subscription management, and notification sending: 30-40 hours.
- Testing and debugging: 10-20 hours.
- **Total estimated time: 65-80 hours.**
